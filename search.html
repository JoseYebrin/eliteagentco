He shared his concerns and eased my worries from property to property until we found one best suited for my needs and wants. Plan on working with the Spicer team in the future!"

                    "Working with Lori was a wonderful experience! She helped us in selling our old house and buying our new house. Lori’s professional knowledge and experience was evident in each step of the process. We never felt stressed or unsure of what to do because Lori kept us up to date and did most of the work behind the scenes for us. Even when we lost offers on our home sale, Lori had a positive and proactive game plan to ensure the best possible outcome for us. In the end we were able to secure a buyer for our old home and purchase our dream home.  We are so thankful to have a realtor that really cares about us and whose passion and expertise in real estate allows her to give her clients the best experience!"

When we decided to go with a builder he guided us through the long process of picking out interior selections, and worked with the builder to correct (at times significant) mistakes. When the buyer of our house proved to be difficult he smoothed over all problems, allowing us to move out a bit earlier than expected. He got us a great price for the house we sold and made what would have been an extremely stressful process as smooth as possible. I cannot recommend him enough."

Shannon is knowledgeable, kind, thorough and a true pleasure to work with. She guided us from hours away while we sold out first home in Virginia. She managed to provide us with a smooth, efficient sale with multiple offers. Shannon made what could have been very stressful process into an exciting, enjoyable and profitable experience.

Despite a 12 hour time difference and limited abilities to communicate via phone, Shannon made my experience so easy! Communication was never a problem. I had a lot of questions and stress, but she answered everything and stayed on top of giving me information so I didn't have to worry. Shannon even went above and beyond: she helped coordinate the installation of new appliances and liaised with contractors to paint and fix small problems since I could not be there in person. I honestly cannot say enough positive things about my experience with Shannon. At the end of the day, I am so pleased with how everything turned out, and I would recommend Shannon to ANYONE needing assistance with selling or buying a home."

Her team handles all the stuff that makes the process easy, not having to deal with a problem is something that makes buying a home a pleasure. Compared to our previous home selling and buying this experience of selling and buying was so easy that I thought it was just too easy and something was going to go wrong but this team is amazing. Knowledge of market, expertise in legal process, updates in process,availability for questions, all meant to us piece of mind. Thank you Denise.",

He was very knowledgeable and took what we wanted from are first home and actually found us homes that fit the requirements we had.
